# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kiyali (aka codekikicode)

Freelance software engineer, future Brooklyn College graduate (December 2025), and certified problem-solver.

Iâ€™m building the kind of career where code meets curiosityâ€”with a focus on neuroscience and ethical use API.

## ğŸ”­ Current Interests & Tech Iâ€™m Exploring

* ğŸ§  **LLM Agents & AI Orchestration**

Exploring LangChain and open-source multi-agent frameworks to understand how language models coordinate and reason in real-time.

* ğŸ“¡ **Real-Time Interaction Systems**

Researching WebSockets and Bluetooth SDKs for potential biometric device integrationâ€”especially around HRV and emotional tracking.

* ğŸ“Š **Signal Visualization & UX**

Passionate about building interfaces that convey **emotional and biometric feedback**, not just raw data.
  Looking into data dashboards, real-time signal visualization, and ethical UX patterns that prioritize clarity, consent, and emotional safety.

* ğŸ§¬ **Ethical AI & Emotional Intelligence**
  
Drawn to projects that prioritize mental health, emotional intelligence, and human-centered API.
My long-term vision: systems that can read the room just as well as they can read the rules.

## ğŸ§° Languages & Tools

* **Languages**: Python (primary for AI), Java (supportive for coursework), SQL (for database integration in AI/data projects), JavaScript (for testing)
* **Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, Git/GitHub, Visual Code Studio, Swing (JOption Pane, JFrame), Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
* **Other Skills**: Technical writing, peer debugging, online research, literary analysis, translating chaos into clarity

## ğŸš€ Featured Project  

**[SecuScript Testing Suite](https://github.com/codekikicode/secu-script-testing)**  
Senior Capstone Project (CISC 4900). Built a **secure, automated testing suite** that integrates **JavaScript, Playwright, and GitHub Actions (YAML CI/CD)**. Designed to streamline application validation, improve reliability, and embed security checks into the development workflow.

## â˜• Let's Connect

I'm always down to chat neuroscience, nanotech, AI, or herpetology (I love snakes!).
