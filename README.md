# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kiyali (aka codekikicode)

Aspiring software engineer, future Brooklyn College graduate (December 2025), and certified problem-solver.

Iâ€™m building the kind of career where code meets curiosityâ€”with a focus on neuroscience and ethical use API.

## ğŸ”­ Current Interests & Tech Iâ€™m Exploring

* ğŸ§  **LLM Agents & AI Orchestration**
  Exploring LangChain and open-source multi-agent frameworks to understand how language models coordinate and reason in real-time.

* ğŸ“¡ **Real-Time Interaction Systems**
  Researching WebSockets and Bluetooth SDKs for potential biometric device integrationâ€”especially around HRV and emotional tracking.

* ğŸ“Š **Signal Visualization & UX**
  Passionate about building interfaces that convey **emotional and biometric feedback**, not just raw data.
  Looking into data dashboards, real-time signal visualization, and ethical UX patterns that prioritize clarity, consent, and emotional safety.

* ğŸ§¬ **Ethical AI & Emotional Intelligence**
  Drawn to projects that prioritize mental health, emotional intelligence, and human-centered API.
  My long-term vision: systems that can read the room just as well as they can read the rules.

## ğŸ§° Languages & Tools

* **Languages**: Java (primary), C++ (intermediate), Python (learning), HTML/CSS (familiar)
* **Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, Git/GitHub
* **Other Skills**: Technical writing, peer debugging, translating chaos into clarity

## ğŸš€ Featured Project

**[Java Coding Folio](https://github.com/codekikicode/java-coding-folio)**
Refactored assignments from CISC 1170 and CISC 3130, built to showcase not just functional codeâ€”but **logical and scalable** code.

## â˜• Let's Connect

I'm always down to neuroscience, nanotech, AI, or herpetology (I love snakes!).
